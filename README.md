# STAT_4188_Assignment_1

My name is Isabelle. I'm a Math-Stats major with a Computer Science minor.
One fun fact about me is that I live on a farm with two horses. I took 
STAT 3255 (Introduction to Data Science) and have experience with data science
projects including exploratory analysis, visualizations, and modelling.

My understanding of the Tom Golway quote is that we often mislabel relationships
between variables as causation without understanding the context that 
defines why the variables may be related.
